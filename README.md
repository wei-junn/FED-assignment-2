# FED-assignment-2
The goal of our project is to create an educational digital literacy platform that teaches online users, mainly students:
1. How to find reliable information from a Google search,
2. Teach Google search techniques
3. How to use critical thinking online
4. Ethical use of online resources
5. Basics of internet safety
and other topics to help them have digital literacy.

They will pick up these skills through short gamified quizzes and courses, and related articles and resources will also be availble to them on this platform. 
There will also be skill ranking assigned to individual profiles (e.g. beginner/intermediate/expert), which will be determined by the number of courses/quizzes completed.
We can also include leaderboards for each quiz that shows the all time high scores for each quiz taken.

Some features that we plan to include are:

User Registration and Profiles:
Allow users to create accounts and personalize profiles.
Collect basic information to tailor the learning experience.

Course Catalog:
Organize courses based on digital literacy topics.
Provide clear descriptions and learning objectives for each course.

Interactive Learning Modules:
Develop engaging lessons using multimedia (videos, infographics, and interactive quizzes).
Ensure content covers fundamental digital literacy topics like internet safety, online etiquette, and basic computer skills.

Progress Tracking:
Implement a tracking system to monitor users' progress.
Include quizzes or assessments to evaluate understanding.

Gamification Elements:
Integrate gamification features to make learning fun and motivating.
Reward users with badges, points, or certificates for completing modules.

Discussion Forums:
Create a community space for users to discuss topics and share experiences.
Encourage interaction and collaboration among learners.

Resource Library:
Compile additional resources such as e-books, articles, and case studies.
Provide a comprehensive library for users to explore beyond the courses.

User Feedback and Surveys:
Collect feedback from users to improve the platform continually.
Conduct surveys to understand user needs and preferences.

Certificates and Achievements:
Issue certificates upon course completion.
Recognize users' achievements and encourage continuous learning.

User Analytics:
Implement analytics to understand user behavior.
Use data to improve content, identify popular courses, and enhance the overall user experience.

Mobile Responsiveness:
Ensure the platform is accessible on various devices, including smartphones and tablets.
Develop a responsive design for a seamless user experience.

Security Measures:
Prioritize the security of user data.
Implement secure authentication and data encryption.

On the desiogn of the web application, we plan to have a blue/green/white color palette, as these 2 colours are associated with technology and education.
We will also choose a minimalist font of a medium font size to use in our web application as it is targetted at students.
